# Compiler-Project
An integrated development environment (IDE), is everything a programmer 
needs to get their work done. An IDE is a good integration of editing, files, 
management, debugger and other functions, which makes the development easier and 
faster. We choose the system binary tools as our project topic and implement all the 
things required including editor, compiler, simulator, linker, loader, assembler and 
debugger. The reason why we choose this topic is that after the group discussion, we 
are all interested in it and think we can learn a lot from the process of programing of 
this topic. In addition, we also learn some related knowledge this semester so that we 
consider this as a great opportunity to practice.
